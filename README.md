This is an Ionic platform port from a previous SPA project: a restaurant website with table reservation, menu filter functionality, and contact forms.  

It uses many of the same Angular directives and controller functions as the web app, but includes further features such as a favorite dishes list, utilizes $ionicPopover and $ionicModal, and takes user inputs unique to touch devices such as swipe and on-hold.
